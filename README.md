# AquaGrow Solutions Website

## Project Overview
This is the static marketing website for **AquaGrow Solutions**. 
The goal of this project is to promote the company's Smart Water Management and Precision Agriculture technologies, which use AI to solve the water crisis and optimize crop yields for farmers.

## Project Structure
This is a standard HTML,CSS & bootstrap project:
* `index.html`: Contains the entire page structure (Navigation, Hero, Solutions, Results, Contact Form, Footer).
* `style.css`: All custom styling for the site.
* `images/`: Directory for all project assets (logos, cards, etc.).

##  Setup & Viewing Locally
To view and test this website locally, no special software is needed other than a web browser.
1.  **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/Ajiththika/Agricultural-website-.git`
2.  **Navigate to the folder:** `cd agricultural-website-`
3.  **Open:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

##  Team & Contribution Guide (AVOIDING CONFLICTS)

To prevent merge conflicts (like two people changing "line 45" at once), the team has agreed to a **Component Ownership** model. Please **only make changes** within the HTML and CSS files relevant to your assigned component.

| Team Member | Components Owned | HTML & CSS Focus Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Roni** | Navigation Bar and Hero Section | The very top of the page (`<header>`, `<nav>`, initial `<h1>/hero` area). |
| **Card/Footer Riththi** | Solutions Cards, Proven Results Cards, Footer | The primary content cards and the very bottom of the page (`<footer>`). |
| **Ajie** | Center Content, Technology Tabs, Contact Form | The main middle sections (where the Technology and Contact areas are). |

### Golden Rule for Conflict Prevention
* **Always use a Branch:** Never commit code directly to the `main` branch.
* **Create a Feature Branch:** For any work, create a separate branch first (e.g., `feature/navbar-Roni`).
* **Review:** When finished, open a Pull Request (PR) for review before merging.

This README clearly defines who is responsible for which *component*, which is much safer than trying to track line numbers.

The final piece of your solution is understanding that **"Always use a Branch"** rule.
